## What makes a great contribution

- Small and focused: one logical change per PR when possible.
- Verifiable: include tests, validation output, or a clear reason when not applicable.
- Traceable: preserve source provenance and attribution for imported knowledge.
- Safe: never include secrets, malicious instructions, hidden payloads, or untrusted executable content.
- Clear: explain why the change improves SkillX, not only what changed.
- Documented: update docs, schemas, examples, or migration notes when behavior changes.

For new or imported skills, prefer contributions that are:

- normalized to SkillX conventions
- scoped to a clear capability
- testable with explicit expected behavior
- free from project-specific secrets or private context
- licensed and attributable when derived from external sources

If you are unsure about scope, start with a short [Discussion](https://github.com/comstrx/skillx/discussions).
